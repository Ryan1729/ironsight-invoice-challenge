##Invoice UI Challenge

This is a small project done as part of the process of interviewing at [IronSight](ironsight.ca).

### Assumptions made
* all users are using dollars of some sort rather than some other currency
* browser floating point accuracy is sufficient for this purpose, (AKA users won't care about rounding to the nearest penny)
